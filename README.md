The NRRA today

Back to TOC ▲

The Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (“NRRA”)

came into effect on July 21, 2011 as part of the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

The purpose of the NRRA was to create a more simplified

and efficient surplus lines tax payment and regulatory

system by limiting regulatory authority of surplus lines

transactions to the home state of the insured and by

establishing federal standards for the collection of

surplus lines premium taxes, insurer eligibility, and

commercial purchaser exemptions.

To date, all states, except Michigan,
as well as Washington D.C., have
enacted legislation to implement the
NRRA although both jurisdictions
continue to comply with the NRRA’s
home state tax approach. These
state laws focus on surplus lines
premium taxation, which is the most
challenging compliance issue for
both brokers and state regulators.

In addition to the tax issue, most of the states have

attempted to conform their laws to the other issues

addressed by the NRRA, including the exempt

commercial purchaser exemption and surplus lines

insurer eligibility standards. However, even if a state has

not taken appropriate action, the NRRA standards still

apply. Therefore, surplus lines brokers must look to both

the NRRA and the laws of the home state of the insured

to determine how to comply with all applicable rules

under NRRA.

What follows is a summary of the key provisions of the

NRRA and its impact on the current regulation of surplus

lines insurance in the United States.

regulations, provisions, or actions of any state that applies

to nonadmitted insurance sold, solicited by, or negotiated

The NRRA empowers the states to create uniform national

with an insured whose home state is another state.

This preemption, however, does not extend to workers’

compensation insurance and any law, rule or regulation

that prohibits placement of workers’ compensation or

excess insurance for self-funded workers’ compensation

plans with a nonadmitted insurer.

The NRRA defines “nonadmitted insurance” as “any

property and casualty insurance permitted to be

placed directly or through a surplus lines broker with a

nonadmitted insurer eligible to accept such insurance.”

Accordingly, to the extent a state allows accident and

health or life insurance to be placed on a surplus lines

basis (and not all of them do), the NRRA’s preemption,

including the “home state” rule, does not automatically

apply to such lines of insurance.

Under the federal act, only the insured’s home state

is permitted to collect premium taxes for nonadmitted

insurance. All other states are preempted from applying

their surplus lines laws to such transactions. As defined in

the NRRA, ‘‘home state’’ means: (i) the state in which an

insured maintains its principal place of business or in the

case of an individual, the individual’s principal residence;

or (ii) if 100 percent of the insured risk is located out of

the state referred to in clause (i), the state to which the

greatest percentage of the insured’s taxable premium for

that insurance contract is allocated. The NRRA also defines

the term “home state” in the context of affiliated groups to

be the “home state” of the member of the group that has

the largest percentage of premium attributed to it under

the group insurance contract. Interestingly, the NRRA is

silent on how unaffiliated groups are regulated, and states

take differing views on this subject.

To facilitate the payment of premium taxes among the

states, the NRRA also allows an insured’s home state

requirements, forms and procedures for insurer eligibility

for U.S. domiciled (foreign) surplus lines insurers. As the

states have yet to adopt a nationwide eligibility standard,

the default standards established under the NRRA are

now in effect in all states. Specifically, a U.S. domiciled

surplus lines insurer needs to meet two substantive

requirements under the National Association of Insurance

Commissioners (NAIC) Non-admitted Insurance Model Act,

i.e., 1) maintain capital and surplus of at least $15 million

(or the minimum capital and surplus requirement under

the law of the insured’s home state if higher); and 2) be

“authorized to write in its domiciliary jurisdiction.”

With respect to alien (non-U.S.) surplus lines insurers,

states may not prohibit a surplus lines broker from placing

non-admitted insurance with, or procuring non-admitted

insurance from, a non-U.S., non-admitted insurer that is

listed on the Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers maintained

by the NAIC’s International Insurer’s Department (“IID List”).

While most states have now amended their surplus lines

laws to incorporate the NRRA requirements, a number

of state regulators are continuing to request financial

and/or premium information as well as a fee in order to

include that company on their state’s eligibility list. While

these lists are arguably “voluntary” (and some states like

California expressly acknowledge the voluntary nature of

their white lists), many surplus lines carriers have opted to

participate as they believe their absence from an eligibility

list places them at a commercial disadvantage in the

market. Moreover, some states continue to expect that

surplus lines insurers will maintain listing on their eligibility

lists and/or “federally authorized” lists and, at times, have

refused to accept surplus lines premium tax remittance

from surplus lines brokers placing insurance coverage

through insurance carriers that are not listed. Some of

these states take the position that they may “confirm

 Under the NRRA, an exempt commercial purchaser is any person purchasing commercial insurance that, at the time of placement, meets the following
requirements: (A) The person employs or retains a qualified risk manager (as defined in the NRRA) to negotiate insurance coverage; (B) The person
has paid aggregate nationwide commercial property and casualty insurance premiums in excess of $100,000 in the immediately preceding twelve
months; and (C) The person meets at least one of the five following criteria: (I) the person possesses a net worth in excess of $29,179,483, (II) the
person generates annual revenues in excess of $72,948,708, (III) the person employs more than 500 full-time or full-time equivalent employees per
individual insured or is a member of an affiliated group employing more than 1,000 employees in the aggregate, (IV) the person is a not-for-profit
organization or public entity generating annual budgeted expenditures of at least $43,769,225 or (V) the person is a municipality with a population in
excess of 50,000 persons. Currently, 20 U.S. jurisdictions exempt non-admitted insurers from surplus lines regulation insurance procured by “industrial
insureds” and an additional 12 states recognize an “industrial insured” exemption with respect to captive insurers or workers’ compensation insurance
only. A complete list of these states and the relevant exemptions can be found in Appendix C.

and Filing

Requirements by State

Back to TOC ▲

The following section summarizes the surplus lines eligibility

and filing requirements of the various states for both foreign

(U.S.) and alien surplus lines insurers. This information is

based upon state surplus lines laws and regulations as well

as responses to surveys that were sent to state insurance

departments and surplus lines associations. Copies of

applications and other pertinent forms may be obtained by

contacting our firm or the state insurance departments directly.

It should be noted that most states treat reinsurance,

independently procured/direct placement insurance,

industrial insurance, and insurance on subjects located

out-of-state as outside the ambit of surplus lines regulation.

SURPLUS LINES LAWS – GENERALLY

Every U.S. jurisdiction has a surplus lines law, although the

regulation of surplus lines business is primarily focused

on surplus lines brokers. Despite the increasing interest

in the solvency of non-admitted insurers, which has made

the approval process somewhat more detailed, there is

still almost no rate and form regulation of surplus lines

insurers. By contrast, licensed insurers in the U.S. are broadly

regulated as to solvency, rates and forms, market conduct,

permissible investments, leverage (whether as to capital

structure, premium to surplus ratio, or limit of risk to surplus)

and affiliate relationships. Licensed insurers are also required

to participate in a variety of government mandated insurance

programs and pay assessments levied by state guaranty

funds in the event of insurer insolvencies.

In theory, in most states, surplus lines insurers may not

compete directly with licensed insurers for business and

should write only business that licensed insurers will not

write. Such “surplus” business must be “exported” by

specially licensed surplus lines brokers who ensure that

the required diligent search of licensed insurers has been

accomplished and who also make appropriate tax and other

filings. Certain jurisdictions maintain lists of coverages which

are deemed to be generally unavailable from the admitted

market (“export” lists), obviating even the need for the

broker to first attempt to place these kinds of insurance with

licensed carriers. A few states have eliminated the need for

the performance of a diligence search of licensed insurers

altogether. In order for an unauthorized insurer to avail itself

of the opportunity to write business under the surplus lines

laws of the various jurisdictions, it must first become an

eligible surplus lines insurer in those jurisdictions.

located.

INSURANCE

Surplus lines is one of two methods of accessing the non-

admitted market. The second method is known as a direct

placement or independently procured placement. This

takes place when an insured elects to go out of the state

and purchase the desired insurance from an unauthorized

carrier either directly with the company or through a broker

or agent not licensed by the jurisdiction in which the risk is

located, such as a Lloyd’s broker.

The right of a U.S. citizen to leave
the state to obtain insurance on
a risk located in the state with an
unlicensed company without being
regulated by the state was first
enunciated by the U.S. Supreme
Court in its landmark decision State
Board of Insurance v. Todd Shipyards
Corporation. In that case, the Court
also upheld the right of the buyer to
be free of taxation on the transaction
if the only contact with the state was
the fact that the insured risk was
located in the state.

In Todd Shipyards, the insurance buyer was located out of

state and purchased property coverage out of state from an

Currently, only 43 U.S. jurisdictions have enacted self-

procurement/direct placement statutes (see Appendix B).

However, since these statutes govern actions by buyers

that are “constitutionally guaranteed,” they are intended

more to tax rather than to regulate the transaction. These

statutes do not prescribe rules or procedures which would

grant jurisdiction over a non-admitted carrier in a self-

procurement transaction, but simply impose a tax on the

insured for the privilege of procuring insurance on its own

behalf. However, recent case law suggests that states that

have not adopted the tax provisions of NRRA may not, in

all cases, tax premium attributable to risks located outside

of the insured’s home state. Thus, subject to the judicial

limitations mentioned above, state statutory authority is

not required for a citizen to leave the state and purchase

insurance from a non-authorized carrier.

Because most states do not have robust statutory

frameworks regulating the direct placement of insurance

policies other than with respect to the taxation of directly

procured polices (in part because states would normally

expect insurance transactions to be conducted through

licensed or surplus lines-eligible insurance carriers), it

can at times be difficult to ascertain what activities would

violate the foundational tenets of self-procurement. For

example, some states expressly prohibit the utilization

of a U.S. broker, whereas other states are silent on the

matter. Moreover, case law decisions in a number of states

(including New York) stand for the proposition that the

insured must physically leave its home state and procure

the insurance policy in a jurisdiction where the insurance

state in the Todd Shipyards transaction was the location of

the insured property. Under this set of facts, the High Court

concluded that under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, the state

was precluded from taxing or regulating the transaction.

available from the admitted market, which may provide

greater protection with more regulatory oversight; and (ii)

the exempt commercial purchaser has requested in writing

that the broker procure/place such coverage with a surplus

lines insurer.

Most states that had industrial insured exemptions before

the enactment of the NRRA are continuing to recognize

these exemptions (see Appendix C). Thus, in those states

where the industrial insured exemption is retained, there

could be two classes of exemptions: 1) For entities meeting

the NRRA exempt commercial purchaser requirements;

and 2) An additional class for entities that meet the

state’s industrial insured exemption. Before utilizing these

OTHER COMMENTS OR REQUIREMENTS

1.

 The Alabama DOI has mandated the use of OPTins

(Online Premium Tax for Insurance) for insurance

companies and brokers filing and paying premium tax

or surplus lines.

 Each individual surplus lines broker is required to file

a tax form ID-15 and payment, with a policy report,

for all surplus lines insurance transacted by him/

her during the preceding calendar year by March 1st

OTHER COMMENTS OR REQUIREMENTS

1.

Arkansas’ list of eligible surplus lines insurers is

available at: https://sbs.naic.org/solar-external-

lookup/. Select “Arkansas” under the “Jurisdiction”

menu, “Company” from the “Search Type” menu, and

“Surplus Lines” under the “Company Type” menu.

2.  Arkansas requires each approved surplus lines

carrier in the state, upon written request, to mail or

deliver the policyholder’s claim information to the

policyholder or his or her surplus lines broker within

30 days from the date of receipt of the request from

the policyholder. Moreover, surplus lines carriers are

not required to file policy forms.

which it is eligible. A “domestic surplus lines insurer”

is subject to the 4% surplus lines tax and would be

deemed to be a non-admitted surplus lines insurer in

the state of Arkansas. It is also deemed to be a non-

admitted surplus lines insurer under the Dodd-Frank

Act. A domestic surplus lines insurer is not subject

to the Arkansas Property and Casualty Insurance

Guaranty Act, or the Arkansas Life and Health

Insurance Guaranty Association Act. All provisions

of the Arkansas Insurance Code regarding financial

and solvency requirements apply to a domestic

surplus lines insurer unless it is otherwise specifically

exempted.

4.

Every insurance contract procured and delivered

as surplus lines coverage must be initiated by or

bear the name of the surplus lines broker who

procured it and must contain a conspicuous

statement substantially similar to the following: “This

contract is registered and delivered as a surplus

line coverage under the Surplus Lines Insurance

Law, and it may in some respects be different

from contracts issued by insurers in the admitted

markets, and, accordingly, it may, depending upon

the circumstances, be more or less favorable to an

insured than a contract from an admitted carrier

might be� The protection of the Arkansas Property

and Casualty Guaranty Act does not apply to this

contract� A tax of four percent (4%) is required to

5.

The Arkansas DOI has clarified that any and all

Lloyd’s syndicates appearing on the NAIC’s Quarterly

Listing of Alien Insurers are eligible insurers in

Arkansas per state statute and in accordance with

the NRRA.

6.

In February 2025, Arkansas SB 76 was signed into

law, which clarifies that if a licensed property or

casualty agent or broker refers a risk to a surplus line

broker, the 20% aggregate fee limit does not apply to

such surplus lines policy.

search requirement); and (3) to require the payment

of premium tax for nonadmitted insurance (i.e. 100%

of the gross premium).

2.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1764(a) allows a licensed California

surplus line broker to issue policies for home

state insureds, in addition to other evidence of

insurance (such as certificates) on behalf of eligible

nonadmitted insurer(s), provided prior written

authority has been granted by the insurer(s). Cal. Ins.

Code § 1765.2(c)(8) requires that the insurer provide a

list to the CDI of these surplus lines brokers and any

additions or deletions to that list.

3.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1763(h)(1) exempts brokers from

conducting a diligent search of the admitted market

if the broker is placing nonadmitted insurance for a

California home state commercial insured as defined

by Cal. Ins. Code § 1760.1(b) and the following occurs:

•

the surplus line broker procuring or placing the

surplus lines insurance has disclosed in writing

placements from the surplus line broker pursuant to

Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1;

•

the nonadmitted insurer’s name is not used in

connection with any of its own nonadmitted insurance

products;

•

the insurer’s unlicensed status, and the nonadmitted

status of the insurance products are disclosed in

the ad in type no smaller than any telephone or fax

number or address shown in the ad;

•

the ad does not contain any knowingly (or that should

have been known) false or misleading information; and

•

the ad does not contain any information about

premiums or rates.

NOTE: For eligible nonadmitted insurers that are members
of groups of insurers, the law allows surplus line brokers

and special lines’ surplus line brokers to include the name

of the group in their advertising.

8.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1760.5(h) permits special lines’

surplus line brokers to advertise and solicit business

in the same manner as surplus line brokers, except

that special lines’ surplus line brokers are not limited

to advertise or solicit with only eligible surplus line

insurers pursuant to Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1.

Most classes of aviation and wet marine are exempt

from Florida surplus lines tax; however, personal and

pleasure aircraft and personal and pleasure boats and

yachts are taxable classes. All such classes unless

they are governmental would be subject to the current

FSLSO fee and any other applicable assessments.

Currently, the only applicable assessment in Florida

is the Emergency Management Preparedness Act,

which is $2.00 (personal lines) and $4.00 (commercial

be applicable to aviation or wet marine. Aviation and

wet marine are not subject to the diligent effort search

requirement.

Fla. Stat. §626.918 (5) also allows a Florida surplus

lines agent to place a risk, in whole or in part, with

an unauthorized insurer (i.e., one not on the Florida

eligibility list) that is otherwise eligible for export in

the surplus lines market, but cannot be procured

from eligible surplus lines insurers, as long as certain

conditions are met. These conditions include: 1) A

signed statement from the Florida agent with the

Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) setting

forth such facts and the percent of the risk placed

with the unauthorized insurer; 2) a $50,000 deposit

with the Florida DOI by the unauthorized insurer

for each such risk; 3) the filing by the Florida agent

of a certified copy of the insurer’s statement of

condition as of year-end showing that the insurer

has net assets at least equal to the amount required

Louisiana recognizes two categories of purchasers

that are exempt from the tax on surplus lines

insurance. The first category is “any college,

university, school, institution, or program that is

under the supervision or management of a system

board of supervisors provided for in [La.] R.S. 17:3215

any political subdivision “having a population of

Any purchaser of insurance claiming the political

subdivision exemption must provide legal authority

to the surplus lines broker to substantiate the

OTHER COMMENTS OR REQUIREMENTS

1.

Bureau of Insurance Bulletin 457 sets forth clear rules

for producers to follow in determining whether to

place coverage in surplus lines:

•  Life insurance, health insurance (except disability

insurance), and employee benefit excess (“stop-

loss”) insurance; reinsurance; and workers’

compensation insurance may not go into surplus

lines.

•  Motor vehicle insurance should not generally

go into surplus lines because an assigned risk

market is available.

insurer may write.

•  The producer must have made a diligent effort

to place the coverage with authorized insurers.

Maine’s diligent effort requirements are arguably

the most rigid. Pursuant to Bulletin 457 a

“producer may not place a risk in the surplus

lines market if the desired coverage exists in the

admitted market.” As such, it is comparatively

difficult for a surplus lines insurer to place

coverage in Maine as compared to other states,

which simply require a producer obtain three

declinations, as opposed to confirm total market

unavailability.

The most effective way to get approval as a surplus

lines insurer in Maine is to provide a unique or

“special” program for which there is a “need” in

Maine.

5.

Exempted coverages (1-4 above) must be placed with

an eligible surplus lines insurer; however, surplus

lines brokers are not required to perform a diligent

search of the admitted market prior to placing the

coverage.

6.

Per Title Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2412-A, any

contract of insurance issued to a large commercial

policyholder pursuant to this section, is also exempt

from the diligent search requirement.

7.

Every insurance contract procured and delivered as

a surplus lines coverage must have stamped upon it,

and bearing the name of the producer with surplus

lines authority who procured it, the following:

“This insurance contract is issued pursuant to

the Maine Insurance Laws by an insurer neither

licensed by nor under the jurisdiction of the Maine

Bureau of Insurance�”

8.

Bureau Insurance 457 sets forth comprehensive

standards relating to the diligent search requirement,

noting that “doing a specific number of inquiries

does not mean that the producer has fulfilled this

requirement” and “[t]he test . . . is whether admitted

coverage is available to the insured, not whether

it is available to a particular producer.” The bulletin

also requires all surplus lines insurers to be on the

state’s eligibility list, and prohibits life, health, stop-

loss, reinsurance, workers’ compensation and motor

vehicle insurance are generally prohibited from being

written on a surplus lines basis in the state.

9.  Maine has a cancellation and nonrenewal statute

expressly set forth under its surplus lines laws.

However, Maine has recently taken the position that

while some of its other cancellation and no renewal

statutes outside of the surplus lines laws do not apply

to the surplus lines market, other cancellation and

non-renewal statutes applicable to certain specific

lines of insurance set forth outside of the surplus

lines laws (such as homeowners’ insurance) do apply

to surplus lines insurers.

Massachusetts insurance producers without requiring

a special insurance broker license, the requirements

of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. § 175:168, including the

agreement) instead of the broker receiving a commission

from the insurance company. The 2014 Bulletin states

that when a broker is paid this kind of a fee, it is

reasonable to include in gross premiums the commission

the broker “would have collected” from the insurance

company. The Bulletin then describes acceptable

methods for approximating a commission. Revenue

Per Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 20, § 200-6.300, surplus

lines taxes apply to policy fees as well as premium

taxes.   The Missouri DOI’s explanation under the

foregoing rule is as follows:

“This amendment clarifies that any fee charged

in connection with the placement of surplus lines

insurance is subject to the surplus lines insurance

premium tax, regardless of whether the fee is

charged by the surplus lines insurer or the surplus

lines licensee� As such the amendment is consistent

with the current practice of the department and

is intended to halt the avoidance of tax by merely

shifting the stated source of fees from the insurer to

the licensee�”

6.  All surplus lines licensees are required to hold an

underlying Property and Casualty producer license

as a prerequisite to obtaining and maintaining the

surplus lines license. Producer licenses are renewed

on a biennial basis on the licensee’s birthday.

was made.

8.  Missouri amended Mo. Rev. Stat. § 384.015 to comply

with the federal Nonadmitted and Reinsurance

Reform Act of 2010 (NRRA) relating to surplus lines

insurance.

Such amendments to the foregoing statute added the

terms “exempt commercial purchaser,” “home state,”

“nonadmitted insurance,” and “qualified risk manager”

to the definition section of Missouri’s surplus lines

laws. The definitions for such terms are consistent

with the NRRA (15 U.S.C. § 8206).

Under Mo. Rev. Stat. § 384.021, a surplus lines

licensee seeking to place nonadmitted insurance

in Missouri for an exempt commercial purchaser

shall not be required to satisfy any requirement to

make a due diligence search to determine whether

the full amount or type of insurance by the exempt

commercial purchaser can be obtained from

nonadmitted insurers if:

•  The surplus lines licensee placing the surplus

lines insurance has disclosed to such exempt

commercial purchaser that the insurance may or

may not be available from the admitted market

that may provide greater protection with more

regulatory oversight; and

•  The exempt commercial purchaser has

subsequently requested in writing the surplus

lines licensee to place such insurance from a

nonadmitted insurer. Mo. Rev. Stat. §384.021.

9.

Per Mo. Rev. Stat. § 384.018, a nonadmitted insurer

that is domiciled in Missouri may be deemed a

domestic surplus lines insurer if the:

•

Insurer possesses policyholders’ surplus of at

least $20 million;

•

Insurer is an approved or eligible surplus lines

insurer in at least one jurisdiction other than

Missouri;

•  Board of directors of the insurer has passed a

resolution seeking to be a domestic surplus lines

insurer in Missouri; and

•  Director of the Missouri DOI has given written

approval for the insurer to be a domestic surplus

lines insurer.

requirements for a domestic property/casualty insurer

to be designated a domestic surplus lines insurer

New Jersey most recently updated its export list in

2015 to include transportation company contingent

liability for workers compensation insurance. This

was the only addition to the list, and there were no

deletions.

of New York (ELANY) and agree to abide by N.Y.

Regulation 41. (N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11,

§ 27). (Eligibility list available on ELANY website at

on ELANY’s eligibility list, the excess line broker

themselves need to maintain all of the information

referenced in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11,

§ 27.13. ELANY takes the view, however, that any

unauthorized insurer that has not been included on

ELANY’s voluntary eligibility list must nonetheless

be vetted by ELANY and issued an approval letter

TYPES OF INSURANCE EXEMPTED FROM SURPLUS LINES
REGULATION

1.  Ocean marine insurance, which is limited to vessels

engaged in the transportation of goods and

merchandise in either foreign or coast wide trades.

However, such insurance coverage must still be

placed through a licensed insurance producer in the

state (although not necessarily an excess line broker).

It does not include yachts, pleasure crafts, fishing

vessels and tugs (see Other Comments section #1).

Part of the risk that is other than ocean marine

insurance, when placed with an unauthorized insurer,

is subject to the payment of an excess line premium

tax for the filing of affidavits and the stamping of

the policies by ELANY as well as other applicable

regulatory requirements of the department. Circular

Letter No. 22 (2000) opines that ocean marine

insurance is “insurance covering damage to ships or

vessels and the goods they carry while on the ocean

or inland waters.” While Circular Letter No. 22 does

not so state, the department has confirmed that pure

marine protection and indemnity insurance is treated

in the same manner as ocean marine insurance.

the foregoing amendment applies to “all liability

16.  The NYDFS issued Circular Letter No. 9(2011)

Amendment to Regulation 41 for public comment.
The proposed amendment expands the types of risks

export list include Builders Risk insurance, Elevator

14.  The NYDFS issued the 14th Amendment to

Regulation 41 and Circular Letter No 9 (2011),
which addresses the allocation issue when a risk

has exposures both in the U.S. and outside of the

U.S. The state has indicated that only that portion in

the U.S. shall be taxed by NY. The amendment also

changed the trust fund requirements. The trust fund

was previously a condition of eligibility but it is now

a substitute for pre-answer collateral. The NRRA

prohibited eligibility requirements imposed by a state

outside of capital and surplus requirements and the

requirement that the insurer be in good standing in

its home state.

15.  The New York State Department of Taxation and

Finance issued a technical memorandum regarding

changes to NY Tax Law Article 33-A. These changes

were necessitated in order to conform to the

requirements of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance

insurance. The memorandum advises that for taxable

members. However, only one set of declinations and

one master affidavit is required for each purchasing

group for all members of the purchasing group

enrolled in a given month.

17.  The NYDFS issued Supplement No. 1 to Insurance

Circular Letter No. 9. The purpose of this supplement

to Circular Letter No. 9 is to provide guidance and

clarification to all insurers eligible to write excess line

insurance in New York and to all excess line brokers

regarding the termination of trusts established

pursuant to New York Regulation 41 prior to the July

21, 2011 effective date of NRRA. Under Supplement

No. 1, if an unauthorized foreign or alien insurer

wishes to terminate a trust that has been established

pursuant to New York Regulation 41 prior to July 21,

2011, then the insurer must do so in conformance with

the trust fund agreement.

18.  The “export list” sets forth types of insurance

coverages that the New York Superintendent of the

Department of Financial Services has determined

coverages. Risks on the “export list” only exempt.

The following new coverages added to the export list

TYPES OF INSURANCE EXEMPTED FROM SURPLUS

LINES REGULATION:

The definition of surplus lines insurance under Or. Rev.

Stat. § 731.144 does not mean reinsurance, wet marine

and transportation insurance, independently procured

insurance, life insurance and health insurance and

annuities. Oregon law also exempts insurers writing wet

marine and transportation insurance from the requirement

to have a certificate of authority. The following risks are

exempt from surplus lines tax: 1) Federal government

entities; 2) Federal and state-chartered credit unions; and

3) Insurance policies purchased by Native American tribes

or tribal member covering exposures located on Indian

reservation (see Other Comments section #5).

OTHER COMMENTS OR REQUIREMENTS:

1.

The Oregon Surplus Lines Association at

www.oregonsla.org does maintain a list of eligible

surplus lines insurers in Oregon for informational

purposes only, not for approval status.

Oregon is a “broker responsible” state and therefore

surplus lines eligibility status for both foreign and

alien insurers is based on the broker’s determination

that the insurer is acceptable. Such informational list

is available at http://www.oregonsla.org/resources/

insurer-listing.

Tel.: (503) 718-6700

Email: Jim@oregonsla.org.

3.

Each insurance policy or certificate of insurance

negotiated, placed or procured by the surplus line

licensee must bear the name of the licensee and the

following legend in bold type:

“This insurance was procured and developed under

the Oregon surplus lines laws� It is NOT covered

by the provisions of Or� Rev� Stat� § 734�510 to

734�710 relating to the Oregon Insurance Guaranty

Association� If the insurer issuing this insurance

becomes insolvent, the Oregon Insurance Guaranty

Association has no obligation to pay claims under

this insurance�”

4.

The Surplus Line Association of Oregon makes

available to any interested party a “tax calculator”

which enables interested parties to easily determine

the taxes and charges applicable to a proposed

transaction. The “tax calculator” may be assessed on

the association’s website: www.oregonsla.org.

5.  Oregon imposes a tax of ¾ of 1% or 0.0075 of the

gross premium amounts plus fees on all non-admitted

Wet Marine & Transportation insurance policies that

the insurance producer places with unauthorized or

non-admitted insurers if the insured’s home state is

Oregon (House Bill 2787).

It is the responsibility of the insurance producer to

collect, file, and pay the tax within 90 days of the

effective date of the policy of premium bearing

endorsement. The filing and payment of the tax

must be done through the Oregon Surplus Line

Association – information is on their website at http://

www.oregonsla.org/.

its diligent search effort in the placement of a policy.

LAWS APPLICABLE TO THE SURPLUS LINES
INSURANCE INDUSTRY

What laws apply to the surplus lines insurance market?

While surplus lines insurers are excused from filing

rates and forms, surplus lines insurance policies are not

completely exempt from state regulation. For example,

many states expressly apply their cancellation and

nonrenewal of insurance policy requirements to the

surplus lines market. Some states traditionally prohibiting

the insurance of punitive damages nevertheless allow

surplus lines insurers to assume such risks. Jurisdictions

also differ as to whether defense-within-limits clauses and

claims-made policy standards apply to the surplus lines

market, to name just a few.

Can personal and commercial automobile insurance be

written with a surplus lines insurer?

It usually depends upon the purpose of the insurance.

Most states specifically require that any personal

automobile insurance seeking to satisfy the “financial

responsibility” requirements of the driver under a state’s

applicable motor vehicle laws be offered only by an

admitted (licensed) insurer in the state. Many jurisdictions

allow for “excess” insurance beyond the financial

responsibility layer to be satisfied through the surplus

lines market. Moreover, some (but not all) states allow

cargo financial responsibility requirements, “Hired and

Non-Owned Auto” (HNOA) and other forms of commercial

automobile insurance policies to be satisfied through

the surplus lines market, subject to a number of various

restrictions and limitations.

as car-sharing and peer-to-peer services), traditional

financial responsibility laws are being revisited. For

example, many states have enacted legislation in the

last few years allowing for the financial responsibility

requirements of drivers for “transportation network

companies” or “TNCs” such as Uber and Lyft to be

satisfied through the surplus lines market. However, states

differ as to whether commercial automobile programs may

satisfy the financial responsibility requirements of their on-

duty drivers through the surplus lines market when such

states have not otherwise granted express authority to do

so, such as in the TNC context.

Does the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) apply to

surplus lines policies?

The TRIA applies to surplus lines insurance policies and,

depending on the nature of the policy, can even capture

insurance coverage issued to non-U.S. individuals with

risks residing in the U.S. Under the TRIA, an insurer is

required to “make available” terrorism coverage on certain

lines of commercial property and casualty insurance

policies. The term “insurer” is defined under the TRIA to

include all licensed insurers in the U.S. as well as surplus

lines insurers. Whether or not an insurer must “make

available” terrorism coverage hinges on whether the risk

itself is located in the U.S. (or with respect to an U.S. air

carrier, flag vessel or at the premises of a U.S. mission), not

where the insured resides.

However, depending on the amount of actual risk actually

located or otherwise attributable to commercial property

and casualty risks in the U.S., federal regulations provide

guidance that small amounts of U.S. risk or commercial

P&C exposure in proportion to an insured’s global risk are

considered “incidental” and not subject to the TRIA.

It depends on the state. While the Nonadmitted and

policy (i.e., acknowledge the policy is acceptable under

the state’s surplus lines laws and charge a stamping fee

in connection therewith) if it offers insurance coverage in

contravention of applicable law. Moreover, states maintaining

stamping offices often levy a fee to stamp the policy.

At least one jurisdiction (New York) also requires the filing of

surplus lines producer agreements with insurance carriers

that grant the surplus lines broker binding authority as well,

of premiums attributed to it. An “affiliated group” is

comprised of entities that are under common control.

While the NRRA addresses how
to treat group policies where all
insureds are affiliated, the NRRA is
silent as to determining the home
state of nonaffiliated groups.

As a result, many states take the position that every

certificate issued is its own policy and the certificate

holder/member’s domiciliary state is considered the “home

state” for each such certificate and require surplus lines

premium tax be remitted accordingly. Some states take

the position that if each member of a group pays its own

premiums, then the “home state’ is not solely the state

of the master policyholder but rather each member of

the group. This rule is expressly codified in many U.S.

jurisdictions with respect to surplus lines group policies

issued through risk purchasing groups (RPGs) as well.

DILIGENT SEARCH REQUIREMENT

How is the diligent search requirement satisfied?

Assuming no exemption is available to a surplus lines

broker or its retail insurance broker partner (such as a

listing on the export list or insurance issued to an exempt

commercial purchaser), most states require three (3)

declinations to be obtained from admitted insurance

companies prior to placing the risk in the surplus lines

market, but this is not uniform throughout the country.

For example, in Maine, under Bulletin 439 (November

26, 2019) “doing a specific number of inquiries does not

mean that the producer has fulfilled this requirement.” By

contrast, a few states (e.g., Louisiana) have eliminated the

diligent search requirement altogether.

Some states require that evidence of the procurement

of declinations simply be maintained in the offices of the

surplus lines broker; whereas, others require that affidavits

be filed with the applicable insurance department or

surplus lines stamping office. A number of states expressly

require the diligent search to be repeated each time a

policy is renewed.

for considering the addition of new, emerging lines of

insurance coverage.

What qualifies as a permissible declination?

Many states expressly disallow price to be the sole

factor for obtaining a declination, i.e., exporting to the

nonadmitted market simply because it offers more

favorable rates than the admitted market will not suffice.

Moreover, some states do not recognize a declination

with respect to a multi-peril policy where components of

such policy could be written by the admitted market (and

some states, like California, only allow exportation in such

case if commissioner approval is granted). In addition,

most states do not recognize declinations obtained

from an insurer that is an affiliate of another insurer from

whom a declination was obtained, and some states do

not allow the placement of surplus lines insurance with

a nonadmitted insurer that is an affiliate of an admitted

insurer from which a declination has been obtained.

Another increasingly-used method
of entering the surplus lines market
is through the establishment of a
“domestic surplus lines insurer”
that is formed in a state solely for
the purpose of writing surplus lines
coverage nationwide.

This strategy obviates the need to utilize two separate

carriers to write surplus lines coverage in every U.S.

jurisdiction (because traditional “admitted” companies

cannot write surplus lines coverage in their home states).

Currently, 21 states have adopted domestic surplus lines

legislation.

WHAT IS “INSURTECH” AND HOW DOES IT IMPACT
THE SURPLUS LINES INDUSTRY?

The term “InsurTech” refers to the wave of technological

innovation impacting the insurance industry, including the

manner in which insurance is sold and administered to the

types of risks for which insurance policies have evolved to

provide coverage.

The surplus lines industry both benefits and suffers from

the emergence of “InsurTech”. The utilization of dynamic

pricing models and other algorithmic underwriting

guidelines takes time to work its way through the admitted

market process of rate and form approval, which is

bypassed by surplus lines insurers. However, surplus lines

products must be obtained through surplus lines brokers,

which restricts direct-to-consumer transactions. Moreover,

surplus lines brokers must conduct a diligent search of the

admitted market (absent an exception), which hinders the

ability to quickly bind surplus lines coverages through the

internet or app-based products.

BACKGROUND

The NAIC has a long history of supporting state insurance

departments’ regulatory efforts regarding insurers

domiciled outside of the U.S. (alien) participating in

the U.S. non-admitted market. Initially acting only as a

repository for alien insurer financial records, the NAIC

has transitioned over the years to its present role as the

recognized authority for alien insurers (Insurer(s) refers

to alien domiciled companies and Lloyd’s syndicates)

seeking approval to write surplus lines business in all

U.S. states and territories. The NAIC International Insurers

The Plan describes how the NAIC’s IID will operate and

how Insurers obtain inclusion on the Quarterly Listing.

The IID is composed of experienced financial analysts

who review applications and renewal filing documents,

prepare written analyses, and provide support to NAIC

surplus lines committees and working groups. The IID also

includes an Internal Review Committee (Internal Committee)

that consists of NAIC directors, managers, attorneys, and

analysts. The Internal Committee reviews IID analyses and

provides a report of recommendation to the Surplus Lines

(C) Working Group (Working Group). The Property and

Casualty Insurance (C) Committee has no direct involvement

in making or approving recommendations regarding

alien surplus lines insurers and is designated the “Appeal

Committee” for decisions made by the Working Group.

The IID functions on behalf of state departments of

insurance by maintaining qualifying standards for Insurers

domiciled outside of the U.S. seeking eligibility to write
direct surplus lines. Section 524(2)1 of the 2010 Dodd-

Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act recognizes

the Quarterly Listing as identifying Insurers for which

states may not prohibit brokers from placing or procuring

non-admitted insurance in the U.S. The Quarterly Listing

is a public document that is posted on the Publications

page of the NAIC website. This list includes Insurers that

qualify for listing as outlined in Section II – Requirements

and Guidelines for Inclusion on the Quarterly Listing.

Modifications to listed companies are summarized within

each Quarterly Listing. The Working Group will make the

final determination of all Insurer eligibility.

Insurers included on the Quarterly Listing are subject

to ongoing review, which includes annual and interim

compliance and qualitative and quantitative analysis.

A� Reporting Requirements

Annual Renewal Filing

All listed Insurers/syndicates listed within the Quarterly

Listing on June 30th of the renewal year are required to

remit an annual fee, file an annual renewal package, and

upload all required renewal filing documents to OPTins®

by June 30th. A comprehensive list of required filings can

be found within the Renewal Filing Memo & Instructions

document within the “Documents” tab available on the

Working Group webpage. Filings submitted after June

30th will be subject to late fees as defined within the

Renewal Filing Memo & Instructions. If an Insurer fails

subject to de-listing.

Notification of Change in Control and Re-Application

Control is presumed to exist if any person, directly or

indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote,

or holds proxies representing 10% or more of the voting

securities of any other person. In the event of a change

Additionally, the Insurer shall reapply within 45 days following

the effective date of the change of control and/or merger of

the Insurer in order to maintain its listing. Failure to provide

timely notice and/or re-application may result in de-listing.

Notification of Decline in Equity (Does not apply to Lloyd’s

Syndicates)

If the Quarterly Listed Insurer’s equity has declined or is

expected to decline by 10% or greater compared to the

most recent year-end or dropped below the minimum

standard described in Section II.A - Shareholders’ Equity

Funds, the Insurer must immediately inform the IID with a

detailed explanation of the decline and a plan describing

the resolution. Failure to provide timely notice may result

in delisting as described in Section V – De-Listing. If an

Insurer is unable to increase equity to the required level

within 15 business days, it may be subject to de-listing.

Trust Fund Monitoring

The Quarterly Listed Insurer is required to monitor the trust

fund balance to ensure that it meets the minimum amount

and takes market fluctuations into consideration. The IID

performs a quarterly review of the market value of each

Insurer’s U.S. trust fund, based on the filing of the trust

fund balance report from the trustee, in order to ensure

that it continues to meet the required minimum balance.

B� IID Annual and Ongoing Analysis of Quarterly Listed

Insurers

Quarterly Listed Insurers are evaluated on an annual basis

and the requirements detailed in Section II -

Requirements and Guidelines for Inclusion on the

Quarterly Listing will be considered as part of that

review. Moreover, the IID analyzes annual renewal and

interim Insurer documentation and may request additional

information as a result of the analysis. If an Insurer fails to

file all additional requested information within the specified

timeframe, it may be subject to de-listing. Following the

overall analysis process, the Insurer will be recommended

to the Working Group for renewal or de-listing. Following

review and a determination by the Working Group, a letter

will be sent to the Insurer.

Sample Weekly Surplus Lines Update
All: Please see below for a sampling of surplus lines updates and reminders for the week.

may charge a fee in addition to the premium provided

that the “aggregate sum of the fees and all producers’

commissions or other compensation due and owing for

that policy or contract does not exceed twenty percent

(20%) of the total gross premium charged the insured

by the insurer for that policy or contract.” Accordingly,

the Bill codifies the Arkansas Insurance Department’s

(the “Department”) interpretation that, if a property and

casualty agent or broker refers a risk to a surplus line

broker, such surplus line broker is exempt from the 20%

fee cap under § 23-66-310.

Applicability: The Bill applies to fees charged by
surplus line brokers; however, all surplus lines insurers

(both U.S. and alien) should be aware that the Bill

codifies the Department’s interpretation regarding the

applicability of the fee cap under Ark. Code Ann. § 23-

66-310(c)(2) to the surplus lines market, which we have

previously reported on.

•  California (Voluntary Action Item for both U.S. and
Alien Insurers): On February 6, 2025, the California

Department of Insurance (the “Department”) issued a

notice, “personal property insurance claims for 2025

Los Angeles wildfires” (the “Notice”). The Notice is

addressed to “all admitted and non-admitted residential

Ins. Code § 10103.7(b). (Emphasis added).

Accordingly, based upon current law, the Department’s

request is voluntary. However, we note that the Notice

further provides that “[b]y this Notice, [the Department

is] requesting that all insurers with total loss claims

advise [the] Department by February 28, 2025 as

to whether or not they will comply with this request

and under what terms.” Insurers should send their

written response to: Patrick Scott, Senior Insurance

Compliance Officer, Patrick.Scott@insurance.ca.gov. A

plain reading of the foregoing “request” that insurers

notify the Department as to whether they will comply

with the request under the Notice also appears to be

voluntary.

which is due on or before 12 p.m. EST on February 18,
2025. The report must be submitted via the Insurance

policies in force in Florida, but no claims to report, must

only submit a “no data” filing for the initial reporting

period. However, when a surplus lines insurer receives

claims, it must begin to report such. We will continue

to monitor the Data Call and, if applicable, provide an

update regarding any potential extensions.

Applicability: The Data Call applies to surplus lines

insurers “property and casualty”, and as such, applies to
