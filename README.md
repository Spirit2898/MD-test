Your broker or the surplus lines broker has determined that this was true on the date the policy was placed. Before issuing a renewal policy or extending this policy, remarketing is required. To avoid intentional or unintentional extension of coverage in the surplus lines market when an admitted market for that coverage exists, a nonadmitted insurer is prohibited from the automatic renewal or extension of a policy without remarketing by your broker or the surplus lines broker.

In order to comply with the Alaska Administrative Code, the following notice is given: You are hereby notified that, under 3 AAC 25�050, your policy will terminate effective no later than the date and time of its expiration� We reserve the right to cancel this policy sooner than the expiration date by giving you notice of cancellation as required in AS 21�36�220� You may request through your broker that a new policy from the surplus lines broker be concurrent with the effective date of the termination of this policy� You are also notified that a new policy, if issued by us, is subject to rerating, which may result in a premium increase of more than ten percent (10%)� As required by 3 AAC 25�050, you are hereby notified that any subsequent policy issued by us may be subject to a ten percent (10%) or more increase in premium� The actual premium will be based upon rates that apply at the time a subsequent policy, if any, is issued and will be made available to you before the effective date of the new policy, or the date subsequent coverage is bound, whichever occurs first�
