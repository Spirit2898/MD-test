Insurance may only be purchased from nonadmitted insurers if the full amount, kind, or class of insurance cannot be obtained from insurers who are admitted to do business in the State of Alaska. Your broker or the surplus lines broker has determined that this was true on the date the policy was placed. Before issuing a renewal policy or extending this policy, remarketing is required.

In order to comply with the Alaska Administrative Code, the following notice is given: You are hereby notified that, under 3 AAC 25�050, your policy will terminate effective no later than the date and time of its expiration� We reserve the right to cancel this policy sooner than the expiration date by giving you notice of cancellation as required in AS 21�36�220� You may request through your broker that a new policy from the surplus lines broker be concurrent with the effective date of the termination of this policy� You are also notified that a new policy, if issued by us, is subject to rerating, which may result in a premium increase of more than ten percent (10%)� As required by 3 AAC 25�050, you are hereby notified that any subsequent policy issued by us may be subject to a ten percent (10%) or more increase in premium� The actual premium will be based upon rates that apply at the time a subsequent policy, if any, is issued and will be made available to you before the effective date of the new policy, or the date subsequent coverage is bound, whichever occurs first�

3.  Arkansas has a process whereby a domestic insurer
possessing policyholders’ surplus of at least $20 million may be designated as a “domestic surplus lines insurer” with the written approval of the Arkansas Insurance Commissioner and be allowed to write surplus lines insurance in any jurisdiction in which it is eligible.

It is also deemed to be a non- admitted surplus lines insurer under the Dodd-Frank Act. A domestic surplus lines insurer is not subject to the Arkansas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Act, or the Arkansas Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Act.

as surplus lines coverage must be initiated by or bear the name of the surplus lines broker who procured it and must contain a conspicuous statement substantially similar to the following: “This contract is registered and delivered as a surplus line coverage under the Surplus Lines Insurance Law, and it may in some respects be different from contracts issued by insurers in the admitted markets, and, accordingly, it may, depending upon the circumstances, be more or less favorable to an insured than a contract from an admitted carrier might be� The protection of the Arkansas Property and Casualty Guaranty Act does not apply to this contract� A tax of four percent (4%) is required to be collected from the insured on all surplus lines premiums�”

Lloyd’s syndicates appearing on the NAIC’s Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers are eligible insurers in Arkansas per state statute and in accordance with the NRRA.

6.  In February 2025, Arkansas SB 76 was signed into
law, which clarifies that if a licensed property or casualty agent or broker refers a risk to a surplus line broker, the 20% aggregate fee limit does not apply to such surplus lines policy.

## Other Comments Or Requirements

1.  When California is the insured’s home state,

2.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1764(a) allows a licensed California
surplus line broker to issue policies for home state insureds, in addition to other evidence of insurance (such as certificates) on behalf of eligible nonadmitted insurer(s), provided prior written authority has been granted by the insurer(s). Cal. Ins.

Code § 1765.2(c)(8) requires that the insurer provide a list to the CDI of these surplus lines brokers and any additions or deletions to that list.

3.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1763(h)(1) exempts brokers from
conducting a diligent search of the admitted market if the broker is placing nonadmitted insurance for a California home state commercial insured as defined by Cal. Ins. Code § 1760.1(b) and the following occurs: •  the surplus line broker procuring or placing the surplus lines insurance has disclosed in writing to the commercial insured that surplus insurance may or may not be available from the admitted market that may provide greater protection and regulatory oversight, and •  the commercial insured has subsequently requested in writing that the surplus line broker procure or place surplus line insurance from a nonadmitted insurer.

placed, on a limited basis, with nonadmitted insurers not eligible under 1765.1 if certain conditions are met (refer to the Code Section for specifics).

7.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1773 permits surplus line brokers to
advertise and solicit in any advertising or marketing medium; these advertisements may include the name of specific nonadmitted insurers as well as the nonadmitted insurance products available, as long as •  the nonadmitted insurer is authorized to accept placements from the surplus line broker pursuant to Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1; •  the nonadmitted insurer’s name is not used in connection with any of its own nonadmitted insurance products; •  the insurer’s unlicensed status, and the nonadmitted status of the insurance products are disclosed in the ad in type no smaller than any telephone or fax number or address shown in the ad; •  the ad does not contain any knowingly (or that should have been known) false or misleading information; and •  the ad does not contain any information about premiums or rates.

surplus line brokers to advertise and solicit business in the same manner as surplus line brokers, except that special lines’ surplus line brokers are not limited to advertise or solicit with only eligible surplus line insurers pursuant to Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1.

9.  Cal. Ins. Code § 703.1(a) permits any eligible surplus line
insurer pursuant to Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1 to advertise in all media, provided all of the following apply: •  his/her unlicensed status is disclosed; •  the ad is truthful; •  the ad does not discuss premiums or rates; and •  specific products are not mentioned in media of general circulation. The prohibition against advertising specific products in “media of general circulation” does not extend to advertising in insurance trade press as well as other trade, industry and special interest publications. Cal. Ins. Code §

703.1; Bulletin 96-4 (May 30, 1996).
10.  For nonadmitted companies not eligible pursuant
to Cal. Ins. Code § 1765.1, advertising is permitted in any media except media targeted primarily at California insureds or prospective insureds, as long as they meet the standards set forth in Cal. Ins. Code § 703.1(a) and do not advertise any information about the insurer’s specific product.

11.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1639(e) permits a non-resident license
to be issued to a surplus line broker and a special lines’ surplus line broker if the non-resident broker holds that type of license in the state or territory of the U.S. where the resident license is maintained.

Cal. Ins. Code § 1768(d) requires non-resident surplus line brokers to keep in the state where he or she is licensed complete records of the business transacted by him or her for California home state insureds with nonadmitted insurers under his or her California non- resident surplus line broker license.

12.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1763(g) allows brokers to extend
existing surplus lines policies by 90-days in the aggregate during a rolling twelve month period without having to file a Confidential Report of Surplus Line Placement (SL-1) and a Diligent Search Report (SL-

2) with the SLA. This policy extension does not allow
any changes in coverage, terms, conditions or limits, however. Any additional premium charged for the extension is determined pro rata, based on the same rate of premium as the existing surplus line policy.

13.  California requires every applicant for a surplus line
broker business entity license to provide names of all persons who may exercise the power and perform the duties under the license. In addition, whenever a surplus line broker licensed as an organization desires to change the persons who are authorized to transact business under the license, it shall immediately file an application with the CDI reflecting the change. The legislation requires all natural persons named to take and pass both the property broker-agent and casualty broker-agent qualifying examinations and become individually licensed as a surplus line broker. Also, surplus line brokers who are only transacting on behalf of a licensed surplus line broker organization are not required to file a $50,000 surplus lines bond. However, all other surplus line brokers who are also placing surplus lines business through their individual license, must still comply with the $50,000 bond requirement. Refer to Cal. Ins.

Code §§ 1656, 1661, 1679, 1765(c) for specifics.

15.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1761(b) authorizes a nonadmitted
insurer that is affiliated with a California domestic insurer to have common directors provided these common directors do not constitute the majority of the voting authority of the nonadmitted insurer and to receive certain administrative services rendered in California by its domestic affiliate (refer to the Code Section for specifics).

16.  Cal. Ins. Code § 1764.1 requires a specific disclosure
statement to be provided to and signed by the insured at the time the producer accepts an application for an insurance policy issued by a nonadmitted insurer, other than a renewal of that policy. This disclosure is provided on a form referred to as either the D-1 or the D-2 freestanding disclosure statement (see below for the form). The difference between the D-1 and D-2 forms is that the D-1 is submitted when the applicant is applying for insurance with a nonadmitted insurer, the insured’s signature is required, and the words “are applying to 2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  26 purchase” are included in the form. The D-2 includes the words “have purchased” and is attached to the policy after it has been issued. The disclosure statements must be printed in 16-point bold type. The agent, broker, or surplus line broker who received the originally signed disclosure statements from the insured must maintain the original in his or her records for a period of at least five years. These records must be made available to the commissioner and the insured upon request.

17.  Every policy issued by a nonadmitted insurer and
every certificate evidencing the placement of insurance must contain or have affixed on its front by the insurer or surplus line broker the D-2 disclosure statement, in 16-point bold type, which contains substantially the same wording as the D-1 statement above but does not require a signature by the insured.

18.  Cal. Ins. Code §§ 1763.2 and 1764.1(a)(1) permit surplus
line brokers to rely upon a signed D-1 disclosure statement obtained by another licensee involved in the transaction as evidence that it was obtained from the insured but only “if it is reasonable under all the circumstances to do so”.

19.  The D-1 disclosure statement is not needed if the
broker has determined that the policy is being issued to an industrial insured (see Cal. Ins. Code § 1764.1(c) for details). However, the D-2 disclosure statement must be affixed to the policy provided to the insured.

20.  California exempts insurers whose insureds have
accepted earthquake coverage that do not meet the minimum coverage requirement but has been approved by the insurance commissioner from being required to offer earthquake coverage with minimum requirements at the renewal.

21.  California enacted legislation regarding insurers’
responsibilities to policyholders in regards to specified residential property, private passenger automobile policies of at least six months’ duration, and individual disability income policies taking effect or renewed on or after January 1, 2016. The legislation provides that insurers must maintain a process allowing a policyholder to designate one additional person to receive notice of lapse, termination, expiration, nonrenewal or cancelation of a policy for nonpayment of premium; requires that insurers must notify insureds in writing or by electronic transmission of that right at the time of application or within 30 days of the inception date and every two years thereafter; or requires that the insurer follow a legally prescribed process as detailed within the law if it fails to follow the process previously described. This process includes: notifying the policyholder of the right to designate one third party to receive notifications as detailed above; maintain records of designee information for the life of the policy; and notify the policyholder every two years of the right to update designee information or make a designation; the insurer may presume this right has been waived if no response is received within 30 days. The law prohibits a policy subject to the law’s requirements from being canceled for nonpayment of premium unless the designated third party has been notified by first-class mail at least 10 days prior to the cancellation date. The law specifies that the designee does not acquire any substantive rights to the policy.

22.  On November 03, 2020, California enacted
Proposition 22, which requires “App-Based Transportation Companies” to provide their drivers certain accident and disability insurance coverages.

In response, CDI issued a February 03, 2021, Notice for “Implementation of Insurance Provisions of Proposition 22,” authorizing surplus lines insurers to provide certain coverages to “App-Based Transportation Companies” on a group basis.

23.  Effective January 1, 2024, surplus lines brokers are
required to include their license number on emails involving an activity for which a person must hold a surplus lines license. The license number must be in a type size that is no smaller than the largest of any street address, email address, or telephone number of the surplus lines broker, see Cal. Ins. Code § 1725.5.

## Eligibility And Filing Requirements (Alien

INSURERS ONLY) A surplus lines broker may place insurance with an alien insurer if that insurer is listed on the Quarterly List of Alien Insurers maintained by the NAIC. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.

tit. 24-A, § 2007(5).


## Eligibility And Filing Requirements (Foreign

INSURERS ONLY) A surplus lines broker may place insurance with a nonadmitted insurer not domiciled in the U.S. if: •  The insurer is authorized to place that type of insurance in its domiciliary jurisdiction; and •  The insurer has capital and surplus, or its equivalent under the laws of its domiciliary jurisdiction that is the greater of the minimum capital and surplus requirements under the laws of this state or $15 million.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  64 The insurance commissioner may waive the minimum capital and surplus requirements for unauthorized foreign insurers if he makes an affirmative finding of acceptability after considering: quality of management, capital and surplus of a parent company, company underwriting profit and investment trends, market availability, and company record and reputation within the industry.

Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2007(4).


## Types Of Insurance Exempted From Surplus Lines

REGULATION (SEE OTHER COMMENTS SECTION #5)

1.  Wet marine and transportation insurance.
2.  Insurance on subjects located, resident, or to be
performed wholly outside of Maine, or on vehicles or aircraft owned and principally garaged outside Maine.

3.  Insurance on operations of railroads engaged in
transportation in interstate commerce and their property used in such operations.

4.  Insurance of aircraft owned or operated by
manufacturers of aircraft or of aircraft operated in commercial interstate flight or cargo of such aircraft or against liability other than workers’ compensation and employers’ liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of such aircraft.


## Other Comments Or Requirements

1.  Bureau of Insurance Bulletin 457 sets forth clear rules
for producers to follow in determining whether to place coverage in surplus lines: •  Life insurance, health insurance (except disability insurance), and employee benefit excess (“stop- loss”) insurance; reinsurance; and workers’ compensation insurance may not go into surplus lines.

•  Motor vehicle insurance should not generally go into surplus lines because an assigned risk market is available.

For other risks, the following conditions apply: •  The insurance must be procured through a licensed producer with surplus lines authority.

•  The coverage must be necessary for the adequate protection of the risk in Maine. This requires the producer to review the needs of the particular risk. If adequate protection is available in the admitted market, then the producer may not place the risk in the surplus lines market.

•  The coverage must be one that an authorized insurer may write.

•  The producer must have made a diligent effort to place the coverage with authorized insurers.

Maine’s diligent effort requirements are arguably the most rigid. Pursuant to Bulletin 457 a “producer may not place a risk in the surplus lines market if the desired coverage exists in the admitted market.” As such, it is comparatively difficult for a surplus lines insurer to place coverage in Maine as compared to other states, which simply require a producer obtain three declinations, as opposed to confirm total market unavailability.

2.  The eligibility list is available at https://www.pfr.maine.
gov/almsonline/almsquery/SearchCompany.aspx.

3.  New England Surplus Lines Association contact:
Richard Martino Tel.: 413-279-9180

4.  The most effective way to get approval as a surplus
lines insurer in Maine is to provide a unique or “special” program for which there is a “need” in Maine.

5.  Exempted coverages (1-4 above) must be placed with
an eligible surplus lines insurer; however, surplus lines brokers are not required to perform a diligent search of the admitted market prior to placing the coverage.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  65

6.  Per Title Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 24-A, § 2412-A, any
contract of insurance issued to a large commercial policyholder pursuant to this section, is also exempt from the diligent search requirement.

7.  Every insurance contract procured and delivered as
a surplus lines coverage must have stamped upon it, and bearing the name of the producer with surplus lines authority who procured it, the following: “This insurance contract is issued pursuant to the Maine Insurance Laws by an insurer neither licensed by nor under the jurisdiction of the Maine Bureau of Insurance�”

8.  Bureau Insurance 457 sets forth comprehensive
standards relating to the diligent search requirement, noting that “doing a specific number of inquiries does not mean that the producer has fulfilled this requirement” and “[t]he test . . . is whether admitted coverage is available to the insured, not whether it is available to a particular producer.” The bulletin also requires all surplus lines insurers to be on the state’s eligibility list, and prohibits life, health, stop- loss, reinsurance, workers’ compensation and motor vehicle insurance are generally prohibited from being written on a surplus lines basis in the state.

9.  Maine has a cancellation and nonrenewal statute
expressly set forth under its surplus lines laws.

However, Maine has recently taken the position that while some of its other cancellation and no renewal statutes outside of the surplus lines laws do not apply to the surplus lines market, other cancellation and non-renewal statutes applicable to certain specific lines of insurance set forth outside of the surplus lines laws (such as homeowners’ insurance) do apply to surplus lines insurers.

5.  Surplus lines tax: 4%, payable by broker.
6.  Massachusetts does not allow the formation of
domestic surplus lines insurers in the state.

insurance with those that appear on the NAIC list.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  69

1.  Licensed in its domiciliary jurisdiction; and
2.  Capital and surplus or its equivalent under the laws of
its domiciliary jurisdiction equal to the greater of the minimum capital and surplus requirements under the laws of the home state or $20 million.

3.  Under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. § 175:160, ocean marine

Gen. Laws ch. § 175:160 specifically permits ocean marine insurance to be placed with non-admitted companies by licensed Massachusetts insurance producers without requiring a special insurance broker license, the requirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. § 175:168, including the payment of a surplus lines fee, would not apply in this instance.

4.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. § 175:168 prohibits accident
and health, workers’ compensation, compulsory motor vehicle liability and life insurance coverage placements in the surplus lines market. However, effective January 14, 2021, Mass. Gen.

## Other Comments Or Requirements

1.  Minnesota’s eligibility list is available at https://www.
sircon.com/ComplianceExpress/Inquiry/consumerInquiry.

Use the link above to connect to the online license lookup tool called ‘Sircon.’ Select ‘Minnesota’ in the state dropdown menu, then select ‘company’ for entity type, ‘active company list’ for inquiry type and ‘surplus lines insurer’ for company type.

2.  Individual licensees are responsible for making sure
that surplus lines insurance is placed only with surplus lines insurers that are in stable and unimpaired financial condition.

3.  An insurer recognized as an “eligible” surplus lines
insurer by the Commissioner is considered to be stable and financially unimpaired.

4.  As alien insurers must be included in the NAIC Quarterly
Listing, such insurers must maintain NAIC capital and surplus and trust fund requirements, whenever greater than Minnesota Statute.

5.  Lloyd’s syndicates must be included in the NAIC IID’s
Listing of Alien Insurers to be considered “eligible.”

6.  Minnesota surplus lines brokers must register with the
Minnesota Surplus Lines Association. Their website is: www.mnsla.com.

7.  Each policy, cover note, or instrument evidencing
nonadmitted insurance from an eligible surplus lines insurer which is delivered to an insured or representative of an insured must have printed, typed, or stamped in red ink upon its face in not less than 10-point type, the following notice: “THIS INSURANCE IS ISSUED


## Pursuant To The Minnesota Surplus Lines

INSURANCE ACT. THE INSURER IS AN ELIGIBLE


## Surplus Lines Insurer But Is Not Otherwise

LICENSED BY THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. IN CASE OF INSOLVENCY, PAYMENT OF CLAIMS IS NOT GUARANTEED.” This notice must not be covered or concealed in any manner.

Minn. Stat. Ann. § 60A. 207 (Note: Minn. Stat. Ann § 60A. 209 requires that the above notice be stamped in red ink on policies that are procured with ineligible surplus lines insurers).

8.  The Minnesota Surplus Lines Association has stated that
that Stamping Fees will be assessed on taxable premium (including broker fees) and not on policy premium.

9.  On January 27, 2014, the Minnesota Department of
Revenue issued a Bulletin to clarify how surplus lines brokers should calculate gross premiums when a policyholder pays the broker a fee under a policyholder- broker agreement (e.g., a policyholder-broker service agreement) instead of the broker receiving a commission from the insurance company. The 2014 Bulletin states that when a broker is paid this kind of a fee, it is reasonable to include in gross premiums the commission the broker “would have collected” from the insurance company. The Bulletin then describes acceptable methods for approximating a commission. Revenue Notice #20-01, which replaces the 2014 Bulletin, adds additional clarity regarding what amount of a broker fee should be included in gross premiums pursuant to Minnesota Statutes section 297I.01, subdivision 9(d).

4.  Mississippi requires the surplus lines agent to
collect a nonadmitted policy fee for any and all risks on real property and contents in Mississippi. This fee is effective on all nonadmitted real property and contents for policies. Residential earthquake and residential flood risks are exempt from the nonadmitted policy fee. Miss. Code Ann. § 83-34-4(1).

5.  Mississippi has eliminated the affidavit requirement
and instead requires a surplus lines insurance producer to execute a form when any policy of insurance or certificate of insurance is procured under the authority of the producer’s license.

7.  Mississippi eliminated the requirement that a diligent
search of the admitted market be made before placing insurance with a surplus lines producer thus making Mississippi the fourth state to eliminate the diligent search requirement, joining Colorado (see the Colorado specific page for additional details), Louisiana, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The legislation also decreases from two to one the number of fire and casualty companies that a producer must be regularly commissioned to represent in order to obtain a surplus lines license and expands the necessary items that must be included in the acknowledgment provided to the insured for personal lines surplus lines policies including that coverage may or may not be available in the admitted market that may “provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight” and that losses shall not be paid by the Guaranty Association in the event of an insolvency.

8.  Annual filing fees for Mississippi foreign eligible
surplus lines insurers should be filed in accordance with certain NAIC procedures: https://www.mid.

Stat. § 384.021, a surplus lines licensee seeking to place nonadmitted insurance in Missouri for an exempt commercial purchaser shall not be required to satisfy any requirement to make a due diligence search to determine whether the full amount or type of insurance by the exempt commercial purchaser can be obtained from nonadmitted insurers if: •  The surplus lines licensee placing the surplus lines insurance has disclosed to such exempt commercial purchaser that the insurance may or may not be available from the admitted market that may provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight; and •  The exempt commercial purchaser has subsequently requested in writing the surplus lines licensee to place such insurance from a nonadmitted insurer. Mo. Rev. Stat. §384.021.

that is domiciled in Missouri may be deemed a domestic surplus lines insurer if the: •  Insurer possesses policyholders’ surplus of at least $20 million; •  Insurer is an approved or eligible surplus lines insurer in at least one jurisdiction other than Missouri; •  Board of directors of the insurer has passed a resolution seeking to be a domestic surplus lines insurer in Missouri; and •  Director of the Missouri DOI has given written approval for the insurer to be a domestic surplus lines insurer.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  91 The superintendent may waive the minimum capital and surplus requirement for a nonadmitted insurer if the superintendent makes an affirmative finding of acceptability after considering: quality of management, capital and surplus of a parent company, company underwriting profit and investment trends, market availability, and company record and reputation within the industry.

does not expressly reference domestic surplus lines insurers; however, the department has indicated that it does permit domestic surplus lines insurers.

The NAIC has also recognized the permissibility of domestic surplus lines insurers in the state.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  92 New York NY GENERAL INFORMATION

1.  New York excess line brokers may place insurance
with those insurers that have made application to and been approved by the Excess Line Association of New York (ELANY) and agree to abide by N.Y.

Regulation 41. (N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, § 27). (Eligibility list available on ELANY website at http://www.elany.org/nyes.aspx?d=1002 (foreign)). In addition, for any unauthorized insurer not included on ELANY’s eligibility list, the excess line broker themselves need to maintain all of the information referenced in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, § 27.13. ELANY takes the view, however, that any unauthorized insurer that has not been included on ELANY’s voluntary eligibility list must nonetheless be vetted by ELANY and issued an approval letter by ELANY prior to issuing coverage in the state.

2.  New York does have an Excess Line Association
(see Other Comments section #5).

3.  New York does have an Export List at www.elany.
org (see Other Comments section #11, #13, and #18).

4.  New York does have an industrial insured
exemption applicable to captive insurers only (see Appendix C) and also recognizes the exempt commercial purchaser exemption as set forth under the NRRA (N.Y. Ins. Law § 2101(x)(2)).

5.  Surplus lines tax: 3.6%, payable by broker to the
state, plus 0.15% stamping fee payable to ELANY (reduced from 0.17% effective 1/1/2023) (Additional fee of $25 applies for late/erroneous filing).

keep 100% of surplus line premium tax where New York is the home state (SB 2811).

surplus lines insurers in the state.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  93


## Eligibility And Filing Requirements (All

INSURERS) The New York law did incorporate NRRA eligibility provisions.

N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, § 27.13 requires that prior to placing business with an eligible excess line insurer, when the insured’s home state is New York, an excess line broker must obtain, review, and retain at least the following documents (unless ELANY obtains and retains these documents):

1.  Copy of insurer’s most recent annual statement
(foreign insurer).

2.  If an alien insurer, evidence that it appears on the
most recent Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers maintained by the International Insurers Department of the NAIC.

3.  Copy of insurer’s latest available report on
examination, if applicable.

4.  A certificate of authority from the insurer’s home
jurisdiction verifying that such insurer is authorized to write the kinds of insurance sought to be placed.

Although ELANY publishes on its website a list of unauthorized insurers which meet the minimum requirements of eligibility in New York, it remains the non-delegable duty of the excess line broker to use “due care” in the selection of any such insurer� (Note: Effective January 1, 2025, New York has a $49 million capital and surplus requirement applicable to U.S.

excess line insurers; Alien insurers must maintain the minimum capital and surplus requirement promulgated by the NAIC.)


## Types Of Insurance Exempted From Surplus Lines

REGULATION

1.  Ocean marine insurance, which is limited to vessels
engaged in the transportation of goods and merchandise in either foreign or coast wide trades.

However, such insurance coverage must still be placed through a licensed insurance producer in the state (although not necessarily an excess line broker).

It does not include yachts, pleasure crafts, fishing vessels and tugs (see Other Comments section #1).

2.  Insurance in connection with ocean going vessels
against, or against legal liability of the insured for, loss, damage or expense arising out of, or incident to, the ownership, operation, chartering, maintenance, use, repair or construction of any vessel, craft or instrumentality in use in ocean or inland waterways, including liability of the insured for personal injury, illness, or death, or for loss of or damage to the property of another person.

3.  Insurance against legal liability arising out of the
ownership, operation, or maintenance of any motor vehicle or aircraft which is neither principally garaged nor principally used in New York, arising out of any activity carried on wholly outside of New York or arising out of the ownership, operation or maintenance of any property having a permanent situs outside of New York, but in case such property or risk is located in any other state, then exemption applies only if the insurer is authorized to do such business in such state and a licensed insurance broker of such state may lawfully place such insurance.


## Other Comments Or Requirements

1.  New York Circular Letter No. 28 (1999) clarifies the
department’s position that if a risk is placed by an unauthorized insurer involving a class of insurance other than ocean marine insurance, it should only be placed through an excess line broker licensed in New York. Such business must also be written pursuant to the surplus lines laws of the state of New York.

Circular Letter No. 28 also states that it is the broker’s responsibility to allocate the risk between ocean marine insurance and any other kind of insurance.

Part of the risk that is other than ocean marine insurance, when placed with an unauthorized insurer, is subject to the payment of an excess line premium tax for the filing of affidavits and the stamping of the policies by ELANY as well as other applicable regulatory requirements of the department. Circular Letter No. 22 (2000) opines that ocean marine insurance is “insurance covering damage to ships or vessels and the goods they carry while on the ocean or inland waters.” While Circular Letter No. 22 does not so state, the department has confirmed that pure marine protection and indemnity insurance is treated in the same manner as ocean marine insurance.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  94

2.  All filings must be submitted to both New York
Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and ELANY unless otherwise stated. Electronic filing of broker affidavits as well as the electronic submissions for recording and stamping of declaration pages, cover notes, binders, endorsements, notices of excess line placement and other excess line insurance documents are permitted provided these methods of submitting for recording and stamping purposes are first approved by the Superintendent.

3.  New York does not require the completion or filing of
insured’s affidavit (Part B) in connection with excess line placements. Instead of the insured’s affidavit requirement, the law substitutes a requirement that such insureds be given notice containing certain information set forth in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit.

11, § 27.5(e).

4.  New York permits binding authority for licensed New
York excess line brokers upon written authorization of non-admitted insurers. This binding authority power was extended by chapter amendment to include both in-state and out-of-state risks. Binding authority agreements must be filed with ELANY and include specific language as promulgated by regulation.

5.  Contact information for ELANY is as follows:
Janet Pane Excess Line Association of New York One Exchange Plaza 55 Broadway, 29th Floor New York, NY 10006-3728 Tel.: (646) 292-5500 Fax.: (646) 292-5505 Email: jpane@elany.org.

6.  The following language must be stamped on
every excess lines insurance policy, memorandum, certificate or other document evidencing insurance coverage delivered to a New York insured in not less than 10-pt bold type: “THE INSURER(S) NAMED HEREIN IS (ARE) NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK, NOT SUBJECT TO ITS SUPERVISION, AND IN THE EVENT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF THE INSURER(S), NOT


## Protected By The New York State Security

FUNDS. THE POLICY MAY NOT BE SUBJECT TO


## All Of The Regulations Of The Department


## Of Financial Services Pertaining To Policy

FORMS.”

7.  New York permits excess lines brokers to place
malpractice insurance for nursing homes and certain other facilities. For these types of risks, three declinations from insurers writing malpractice insurance are required. For doctors, dentists and general hospitals, a declination must be obtained from the resident market, known as the “MMIP” or the “Pool,” before placing primary coverage with an excess line insurer.

8.  The Office of General Counsel of the NYDFS issued
two opinions, which state that policy fees charged by an excess line insurer are to be considered excess line premium subject to the excess line tax and the ELANY stamping fee.

9.  The 10th amendment to Regulation No. 41 changed
the maximum deposits required in which Alien insurance companies eligible in New York must put in trust to secure payment of judgments. Such amendment is intended to conform New York regulation to new trust fund requirements adopted by the International Insurers Department of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

10.  New York amended N.Y. Ins. Law §§ 2601 and
3420 and Section 3001 of the Civil Procedure Law and Rules (“CPLR”). Among other things, such amendment prohibits insurers from denying a claim under policies issued in New York based on late notice unless the insurer can show that it was prejudiced by the untimely notice, and would also allow an underlying plaintiff to bring a declaratory judgment action directly against the tort feasor’s insurer under limited circumstances. The New York Insurance Department also issued a Circular Letter 26 (2008), dated November 18, 2008, to clarify that the foregoing amendment applies to “all liability policies,” including renewals, issued or delivered in New York on or after the amendment’s effective date, including those policies issued in the excess/ surplus lines market. It therefore appears that that the foregoing amendment’s treatment of claim’s made policies will apply to claims-made policies which may only be issued in New York by unauthorized insurers through the excess/surplus lines market.

11.  The NYDFS promulgated the 11th Amendment
to Regulation 41 in order to expand the export list. The new coverages added to the export list included: commercial excess and umbrella liability (over $10,000,000), commercial property (excess of $50,000,000), contract frustration, employed lawyers’ liability, construction contractors liability coverage, owner’s contractor’s protective, prize indemnification, special events, and vacant commercial property.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  95

12.  Pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, §
27.13, New York has a $45 million capital and surplus
requirement applicable to U.S. excess line insurers; alien (non-U.S.) insurers must maintain the minimum capital and surplus requirement promulgated by the NAIC. The foregoing regulation also provides as of January 1, 2016, and every three years thereafter, the minimum surplus to policy holders requirements shall increase by $1 million. As such, as of January 1, 2025, New York has a $49 million capital and surplus requirement applicable to U.S. excess line insurers.

13.  The NYDFS issued a proposed draft 13th
Amendment to Regulation 41 for public comment.

The proposed amendment expands the types of risks to be added to the so-called “export list.” Some of the proposed risks to be included on the New York export list include Builders Risk insurance, Elevator Service and Maintenance Contractors – Liability and Property Damage, Excess Professional/Errors & Omissions Liability – All Classes, Excess Salary Protection (Disability) Insurance, Large Law Firm Lawyers’ Professional Liability Insurance, and Primary and/or Excess “Liability” Insurance for vacant or unoccupied buildings.

14.  The NYDFS issued the 14th Amendment to
Regulation 41 and Circular Letter No 9 (2011), which addresses the allocation issue when a risk has exposures both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. The state has indicated that only that portion in the U.S. shall be taxed by NY. The amendment also changed the trust fund requirements. The trust fund was previously a condition of eligibility but it is now a substitute for pre-answer collateral. The NRRA prohibited eligibility requirements imposed by a state outside of capital and surplus requirements and the requirement that the insurer be in good standing in its home state.

15.  The New York State Department of Taxation and
Finance issued a technical memorandum regarding changes to NY Tax Law Article 33-A. These changes were necessitated in order to conform to the requirements of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA) for independently procured insurance. The memorandum advises that for taxable insurance contracts independently procured from an unauthorized insurer with an effective date on or before July 21, 2011, tax payers should use form CT-33-D(4/11) and for taxable insurance contracts independently procured from an unauthorized insurer with an effective date on or after July 21, 2011, taxpayers should use form, CT-33-D(7/11).

The fundamental difference in these forms is that transactions effective on or before July 20, 2011 continue to be tax allocated while transactions effective on or after July 21, 2011 are taxed on 100% of the gross written premium.

16.  The NYDFS issued Circular Letter No. 9(2011)
regarding “home state” determination for purchasing group (PG) members.

The circular letter states that excess line brokers must file affidavits and related individual certificate of insurance for each individual New York “home stated” member of the PG and pay premium taxes only to New York for New York “home stated” PG members. However, only one set of declinations and one master affidavit is required for each purchasing group for all members of the purchasing group enrolled in a given month.

17.  The NYDFS issued Supplement No. 1 to Insurance
Circular Letter No. 9. The purpose of this supplement to Circular Letter No. 9 is to provide guidance and clarification to all insurers eligible to write excess line insurance in New York and to all excess line brokers regarding the termination of trusts established pursuant to New York Regulation 41 prior to the July 21, 2011 effective date of NRRA. Under Supplement No. 1, if an unauthorized foreign or alien insurer wishes to terminate a trust that has been established pursuant to New York Regulation 41 prior to July 21, 2011, then the insurer must do so in conformance with the trust fund agreement.

18.  The “export list” sets forth types of insurance
coverages that the New York Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services has determined are generally not available from licensed insurers.

Three declinations are not required for export list coverages. Risks on the “export list” only exempt.

The following new coverages added to the export list will require no declinations: 2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  96 Asbestos, Fungi and Water Damage Remediation and Removal Liability and Property Damage.

Builders Risk Insurance Coverage for construction projects where the total insured values exceed $10,000,000.

Elevator Service and Maintenance Contractors Liability and Property Damage.

Excess Professional/Errors & Omissions Liability – All Classes Excess liability coverage where the underlying policy limits and/or self-insured retention is at least $10,000,000 per occurrence.

Excess Salary Protection (Disability) Insurance as a monoline policy Insurance pursuant to N.Y. Ins. Law § 1113 (a)(31) (A) against financial loss caused by the cessation of earned income due to disability from sickness, ailment or bodily injury, in an amount up to that portion of an individual’s annual earned income, which is in excess of the amount of in-force disability insurance from an authorized insurer, [in amount not to exceed 75% of the individual’s annual earned income in total based upon the sum of in-force disability insurance and salary protection insurance when benefits are payable to individual or individual’s beneficiary.] Large Law Firm Lawyers’ Professional Liability Insurance (LPL) Professional liability for a law firm that has more than 100 attorneys.

Recreational Guide Services Coverage for outfitters and guides for Camping, Hiking, Rafting, Bungee Jumping, Parachuting, Hunting and Fishing Clubs, Shooting Ranges, Hunting and Fishing and similar recreational activities.

Vacant or Unoccupied Buildings Primary and/or Excess “Liability” Insurance for vacant or unoccupied Buildings.

19.  The following changes were included in the
final adopted version of the 14th Amendment to Regulation 41: a) Neither ELANY nor excess line brokers will be required to obtain: •  An insurer’s prospective three-year business plan, •  An executed copy of the insurer’s trust agreement and periodic “funds in trust statement” from the trustee, alien insurer IID Standard Financial Statements. (See II, 3 below) b)  Foreign insurers will no longer be required to establish a $2.5 million trust fund. Such trust funds which currently exist may be terminated in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement.

c)   Service of Process/Consent to Jurisdiction.

•  N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, §27.16 of Regulation 41 is deleted. This removed from the regulation but Not From the Insurance Law requirements regarding consent to service of process and appointing the superintendent as agent for service of process. Eligible insurers should note that N.Y. Ins. Law §1213(c) exempts unauthorized insurers from posting collateral or pre-answer security in litigation on risks placed through excess line brokers when the policy designates the superintendent as the lawful attorney upon whom lawful process may be served.

d)  The following obligations are now directed at insurers where previously the excess line broker was responsible to verify the insurers conduct: •  The insurer will be directly required to file an electronic EL-1 report on March 15 each year setting forth each New York excess line transaction bound in the prior calendar year; •  Unauthorized insurers will be directly prohibited from selling a) types of coverage which the excess line law bars excess line brokers from selling, b) coverages which are not recognized as legal types of insurance in New York, c) coverages which are prohibited by public policy; and •  Insurers will be directly required to treat payment of premium to the excess line broker as payment to the insurer.

The following provisions of Regulation 41 remain unchanged: a)  Excess line brokers will continue to be required to obtain the following unless ELANY obtains these documents: •  A copy of a foreign insurer’s most recent annual statement; •  Evidence that the insurer is on the current IID Quarterly listing (alien insurers only); •  A copy of the insurer’s latest report on examination, only if accessible to the excess line broker; and •  A certificate of authority from the insurer’s home jurisdiction verifying the kinds of insurance the insurer is permitted to underwrite.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  97 b)  Effective 1/1/2017, foreign insurers must maintain at least $46 million of policyholder surplus to be eligible.

c)    Also, excess line brokers shall not place coverage with an insurer unless the insurer’s financial statements or other evidence demonstrates: •  The insurer is solvent and otherwise complies with the solvency requirements for the authorized insurers; •  Has surplus sufficient to support its writings, reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs; •  Claims practices have been, and continue to be, satisfactory; and •  Management is trustworthy and competent.

d)   Any time an excess line insurer does not meet the standards noted above, an excess line broker must: •  Cease procuring from such insurer, and •  Notify in writing within 10 days, the superintendent, excess line association, any producing broker and each insured, that coverage should be replaced in the excess line broker’s judgment.

20.  ELANY issued Bulletin 2014-07 on explaining only
premium and other taxable consideration for the insurance policy should be included on a binder or declarations page.

ELANY issued Bulletin 2014-08 stating that any entity or individual acting as a cover holder, managing general agent, managing general underwriter, or program administrator from a New York office, pursuant to a binding authority agreement entered into with an eligible excess line insurer must be properly licensed as an excess line broker and must file the binding authority agreement with ELANY

21.  ELANY’s stamping fee was reduced to 0.15% for
policies incepting on or after January 1, 2023.

22.  The New York Department of Taxation and Finance
issued two Advisory Opinions (TSB-A16(4)C and TSB-A-16(5)C) that eligible surplus lines insurers are subject to franchise taxes on insurance Companies and those taxes are not limited by NY Tax Law §1505(a)(1). ELANY issued Bulletin No. 2016-17 noting that these opinions are consistent with previous opinions by this Department.

23.  The New York State Department of Financial Services
(DFS) amended Regulation 41 in order to regulate Transportation Network Company (TNC) group insurance policy coverage. TNCs are ridesharing companies such as Uber and Lyft.

Excess line compliance procedures for TNC group insurance policies when New York is the home state of insured are set forth in amendments to Regulation 41, Regulation 35-D and the new TNC Regulation 35-E.

15th Amendment to Regulation 41: __  A consolidated affidavit Part A and Part C, where applicable, for the group policy must be filed.

__  The total exemption from Regulation 107 (Defense within Limits) and Regulation 121 (Claims Made Policies) for excess line policies is rolled back as these regulations will not apply to excess line coverage for TNC group policies.

Regulation 35-E __  Before procuring a TNC group insurance policy from an unauthorized insurer, an excess line broker needs to obtain declinations from three authorized insurers even if the insured meets the definition of an “exempt commercial purchaser.” __  TNC group insurance coverage may not be added to the “export list.” __  The declinations obtained shall be valid for one year and apply to all of the drivers insured under the group policy.

established a group peer-to-peer car sharing regime in New York allowing surplus lines insurers to issue group liability and P&C coverage to car sharing programs and the shared vehicles used thereunder.

28.  New York passed legislation (SB 8127), which
simplifies the excess line insurance placement affidavit requirements by allowing an affidavit to list the name and national association of insurance commissioners code of each authorized insurer declining a risk and that no additional diligent effort information shall be reported on the affidavit.

29.  In December 2024, SB 9420 was signed into
law, which provides for a definition of parametric insurance under N.Y. Ins. Law § 1113. Moreover, SB 9420 amended N.Y. Ins. Law § 3416, which expressly permits excess lines brokers to place parametric insurance with excess line insurers.

The surplus lines producer must maintain the signed notice in its file for a period of five years from expiration of the policy.

Funds will be derived from fines and penalties imposed on unlicensed insurance entities and licensed entities that are doing insurance business in Texas without a license.

10.  The Texas legislature enacted legislation that
made significant reforms to the operation of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. It affects surplus lines insurers in that it redefines the types of policies subject to premium allocation reporting and potential surcharging for the funding of Class 2 public securities.

11.  Texas has enacted legislation to align state law to the

12.  A policy issued by an eligible surplus lines insurer
or a certificate of insurance issued by the surplus lines agent must contain a provision stating and designating the person to whom the commissioner is to mail process. The plaintiff must supply this address in any citation served under this section.

A surplus lines document issued by an eligible surplus lines insurer must state, in 11-point type, the following: This insurance contract is with an insurer not licensed to transact insurance in this state and is issued and delivered as surplus line coverage under the Texas insurance statutes� The Texas Department of Insurance does not audit the finances or review the solvency of the surplus lines insurer providing this coverage, and the insurer is not a member of the property and casualty insurance guaranty association created under Chapter 462, Insurance Code� Chapter 225, Insurance Code, requires payment of a (insert appropriate tax rate) percent tax on gross premium� A surplus lines document issued by a domestic surplus lines insurer must state in, in 11-point type, the following: This insurance contract is issued and delivered as surplus lines coverage under the Texas Insurance Code� The insurer is not a member of the property and casualty insurance guaranty association created under Insurance Code Chapter 462� Insurance Code Chapter 225 requires payment of a (insert appropriate tax rate) percent tax on gross premium� A surplus lines document must show: •  the description and location of the subject of the insurance; •  the coverage, conditions, and term of the insurance; •  the premium and rate charged, and premium taxes to be collected from the insured; •  the name and address of: •  the insured; •  the insurer; •  the insurance agent who obtained the surplus line coverage; and •  if the direct risk is assumed by more than one insurer: •  the name and address of each insurer; and •  the proportion of the entire direct risk assumed by each insurer.

13.  Texas has enacted legislation which exempts from
diligent effort requirements any industrial insureds that employ qualified risk managers, have aggregate nationwide commercial insurance premiums of $25,000 in the previous year and have 25 full-time employees.

14.  The Texas DOI repealed and replaced Chapter 15 of
the Texas Administrative Code. The repeal of existing 2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  127 Chapter 15 and the adoption of new Chapter 15 were necessary to implement legislation that amended Chapter 981 of the Texas Insurance Code, concerning surplus lines insurance.

SB 951 amended Insurance Code Chapter 981 to comply with the Non-admitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (NRRA). The NRRA is a section of the Dodd-Frank Act that governs surplus lines insurance.

SB 951 clarified that Chapter 981 applies to surplus lines insurance if the insured’s home state is Texas, provides applicable definitions, exempts commercial purchasers, and states that agreements regarding uniform surplus lines insurance standards made between Texas and other states are binding. The repeal of sections conflicting with SB 951 and 28 Tex.

Admin. Code §§ 15.1, 15.4, 15.110, 15.111, and 15.301 address requirements of SB 951.

HB 1405 amended Insurance Code Chapters 225 and 981, and relates to the collection of surplus lines insurance premium taxes for insurance placed with a managing underwriter. HB 1405 clarifies that in instances where more than one individual with a surplus lines license is involved in a transaction, the parties may enter into a written agreement at or before the time coverage is bound under the policy stating which party is responsible for the typical agent’s duties. HB 1405 requires the surplus lines agent and the managing underwriter maintain a record of the agreement with each policy to which the agreement applies. 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.108 addresses requirements of HB 1405.

SB 697 amended Insurance Code Chapter 981 to allow non-resident surplus lines agents to do business in Texas without a property and casualty license, provided they comply with their domiciliary state’s licensing requirements. To qualify, the non- resident surplus agent must also have a professional relationship with a licensed property and casualty agent in Texas who first conducts a search for available coverage from an admitted insurer in Texas before placing insurance through the non-resident surplus lines agent. The non-resident surplus lines agent must also supply sufficient information to the Commissioner demonstrating that the agent’s home state does not require property and casualty licensure to obtain a surplus lines license. 28 Tex.

Admin. Code § 15.4 and 15.5 address requirements of HB 697.

HB 1559 amended Chapter 981 to authorize a surplus lines agent to offer coverage to an industrial insured that employs or retains a qualified risk manager and either pays annual premiums of at least $25,000 or employs at least 25 employees, without first satisfying Tex. Ins. Code Ann. § 981.004(a)(1). Tex.

Ins. Code Ann. § 981.004(a)(1) addresses whether the full amount of required insurance can be obtained, after a diligent effort, from an insurer authorized to write and writing that kind and class of insurance in Texas. The bill also requires that the surplus lines agent keep certain records related to the insured’s qualifications as an industrial insured. 28 Tex. Admin.

Code § 15.110 and §15.112 address requirements of HB

1559.
HB 2492 amended Chapter 981 to authorize a property and casualty insurance company organized under statutory provisions of the Insurance Code that has capital and surplus in an amount of at least $15 million dollars to apply to TDI for designation as a domestic surplus lines insurer. 28 Tex. Admin. Code § §15.5 and 15.301 address requirements of HB 2492.

Also included in the repeal of Chapter 15 is the repeal of tax rules related to the calculation or allocation of premium taxes, because taxes are under the scope of the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Repealing these types of tax rules in Chapter 15 avoids potential conflicts between the Texas DOI’s and the comptroller’s rules. The comptroller’s rules are in 34 Tex. Admin. Code Part 1.

In addition to statutory reasons and rule review, the newly adopted sections contain language to clarify requirements for the industry and consumers.

2025 Excess and Surplus Lines Laws Manual  |  128 In addition to organizing the sections into four subchapters, it also breaks requirements into short subsections and paragraphs to aid readability.

In total, there are six sections that do not contain provisions similar to those in the repealed sections: 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.3, relating to regulation of policies; 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.7, relating to submission of applications, notices, and correspondence; 28 Tex. Admin. Code §

15.111, relating to exempt commercial purchaser
documentation; 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.112, relating to industrial insured documentation; 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.114, relating to untimely filed policies; and 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 15.201, relating to Commissioner approval of the stamping office’s plan of operation.

15.  Texas has eliminated the diligent search requirement
for exporting flood insurance to the surplus lines market when the carrier has a financial strength rating of A- or better from the A. M. Best Company or with respect to commercial flood insurance not provided through the National Flood Insurance Program.
